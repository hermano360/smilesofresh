									<h2>Meet Your Pediatric Dentist</h2>
									<h4>Dr. Christine Chu, DDS</h4>
								</header>
								<p>Dr. Christine graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with a B.S. degree in Biology. She then attended dental school at the University of Southern California (USC) School of Dentistry and was awarded the Floyde E. Hogeboom Award for Outstanding Achievement in Pediatric Dentistry. After volunteering in various mobile clinics, Dr. Christine’s interest in pediatric oral care grew and she went on to receive her speciality degree in Pediatric Dentistry from UCLA. Through a mutual patient, Dr. Christine met Dr. Howard. Due to Dr. Howard’s persistence and charm, she eventually fell in love with him. As the saying goes, the rest is history!</p><p>

Dr. Christine loves talking and interacting with children. Her specialty is making sure children are comfortable and relaxed during treatment. She has a very gentle approach and treats all patients as if they were her own. In addition, she is trained in advanced sedation techniques to further help children. Her pediatric rooms also have TV's and movies to help children find their happy zone.
</p><p>
Dr. Christine's goal is to give all children a positive dental experience. From infants to adolescents, Dr. Christine hopes to make an impact on oral health and keep her patients smiling into adulthood.
</p><p>
In her free time, Dr. Christine is an avid foodie that loves to try new restaurants. She also enjoys barre workouts and baking sweet treats for her family and friends. Her favorite activity at the moment is hanging out with her 1-year old son, Blake, and watching his appetite and personality grow!</p>

							<h2>Meet Your Orthodontist</h2>
							<h4>Dr. Howard Chu, DMD, MS</h4>
						</header>
							<p>Dr. Chu attended Harvard University, where he graduated with honors and served as the president of his class. He was then selected to attend the elite three year Orthodontics Residency program at UCLA, where he would eventually meet Dr. Christine through a mutual patient. During his time at UCLA, Dr. Chu served as chief resident and became a board-certified specialist in orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics. Dr. Chu is a published author and has presented his research to international audiences.
</p><p>
Dr. Chu grew up in Chandler, AZ where he attended the prestigious Barrett Honors College at the Arizona State University. During his time at ASU, Dr. Chu served as president and founder of the Health Care Coalition, the largest student health care organization on campus.
</p><p>
His love for connecting with people as well as helping each patient achieve their individual goals is what drove him to open his own practice with Dr. Christine. For Dr. Chu, the best part of being an orthodontist is working with every patient in creating the most beautiful smile in the most efficient way.
</p><p>
In his free time, Dr. Chu enjoys staying active and healthy. He is an avid crossfitter and enjoys olympic weightlifting. As a new father, Dr. Chu loves teaching his 1-year old son, Blake, how to say “ba-ba”. Ask him anything about orthodontics and he’ll be more than happy to provide an informative and straightforward explanation.</p>
