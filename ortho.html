				<h2>Junior</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				Children 7 to 11
			</p>
			<p>
				You probably have a million questions regarding your child’s orthodontic needs: Are those teeth baby teeth? When will those teeth be lost? Will those spaces close? Are my son’s jaws fitting together correctly? What age should my daughter be losing her baby teeth? What happens if they do not get braces? Will my kids even need braces?

				You probably have a million questions regarding your child’s orthodontic needs: Are those teeth baby teeth? When will those teeth be lost? Will those spaces close? Are my son’s jaws fitting together correctly? What age should my daughter be losing her baby teeth? What happens if they do not get braces? Will my kids even need braces?
			</p>
			<p>
				Each child is unique and come with their own individual set of dental and facial issues that should be watched over time. The American Association of Orthodontists recommends that a child has their first Orthodontic exam at age 7. At this early age, orthodontic treatment may not be necessary, but this allows us to monitor your child to ensure proper treatment is done at the right time.
			</p>
			<p>
				At Fresh Orthodontics and Pediatric Dentistry, Dr. Chu will evaluate your child’s facial pattern to look for proper balance, symmetry and growth. He will carefully account for all the baby and adult teeth, take the appropriate x-rays and make sure you know exactly when and how to go about helping your child obtain the most phenomenal smile with properly aligned teeth. We will work with you to minimize problems that come while children grow into their face and jaws. Above all, Dr. Chu wants to make sure every child feels at ease and comfortable getting check-ups before actual treatment is needed. Dr. Chu believes that the key for successful results, regardless of treatment type, is to have a great doctor-patient relationship.
			</p>

			</p>
			<h4>
				OBSERVATION
			</h4>
			<p>
				No treatment. This is a very important treatment decision. This allows us to take a step back and observe a child’s facial and dental growth every 6 months and recommend treatment only when needed. Most children will fall into this category. We do not believe in charging for these semi-annual Fresh Junior check-ups because of the importance of monitoring your child’s growth. If treatment is indicated, finances will be discussed at that time.
			</p>
			<h4>
				PHASE I BRACES
			</h4>
			<p>
				A few brackets on key teeth. The goal is to make space for incoming adult teeth or to correct teeth that are causing harm to the gums, teeth or bite. Once the problem is corrected, a retainer will be used to hold all the changes until all the permanent teeth are present. Since - Phase I - braces are typically followed by normal teenage/adult braces, our goal is to make the experience as fun as possible.
			</p>
			<h4>
				EXPANDERS
			</h4>
			<p>
				Slowly widens the jaws to make room for the incoming adult teeth. Don’t worry, during the consultation we will explain why, when, and how to these are used.

				<h2>Teens</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				Every teen is different. They are interested in different activities, music and food. As overly concerned parents, you have enough to worry about. Here, at Fresh Orthodontics and Pediatric Dentistry, we want you to leave their smile to us. Their smile is such an important part of who they are and how they are viewed and we got you covered.
			</p>
			<p>
				Common questions that you may have: Does my daughter HAVE to have braces? How long will they need the braces? What happens if she doesn’t get braces? Can my son have Invisalign? Why should I even care about an overbite? Will they need to get a headgear? We understand that you have questions, and we are here to answer them for you.
			</p>
			<p>
				At Fresh Orthodontics and Pediatric Dentistry, we treat each teen uniquely and individually. Some teens will need braces and rubber-bands, while others will use Invisalign or simply just a retainer. There is no “one-size-fits-all” in orthodontics and we are here to provide the most functional, best-looking, and efficient result possible. We want your teen to have a proper bite all while developing an amazing FRESH and confident smile. So, stop worrying, and leave it to us. We’ve got your busy teen covered.
			</p>
			<p>
				Call or sign-up for a free consultation and let us help your teen achieve a FRESH and confident smile.

			<h4>
				TRADITIONAL METAL BRACES
			</h4>
			<p>
				Modern traditional braces are smaller and more comfortable than they used to be. These are the braces that you remember. A metal wire is aligned over your brackets and held in place with elastic bands.
			</p>
			<p>
				Choose your colors! Each time you come in, you get to pick your FRESH new colors.
			</p>
			<h4>
				CLEAR BRACES
			</h4>
			<p>
				These are braces that look and blend in with your teeth. Using a tooth colored ceramic material, your braces will be less visible to others. Your friends won’t even be able to tell.
			</p>
			<h4>
				INVISALIGN
			</h4>
			<p>
				Clear retainer-type appliance that is changed a few times a month to move teeth incrementally.

			<h4>
				HOW IT WORKS
			</h4>
			<p>
				Invisalign is a series of custom-fitted durable aligners that straighten your teeth over time. The clear aligners are made of durable and comfortable material - no wires, no metal
			</p>
			<p>
				Using the state-of-the-art 3D digital imaging technology, Dr. Chu will take a digital impression (no impression trays or gooey moldings) to create a personalized treatment plan that will gently and gradually move your teeth into place. Each clear aligner will be roughly worn for 1-2 weeks, before switching to the next aligner in the series, until your teeth are perfectly aligned.
			</p>
			<p>
				Invisalign is designed to provide you with your dream smile without getting in the way of your normal life.
				Each aligner can be removed prior to each meal so you won’t have to change your diet
				Hygiene will also not be affected as you can brush and floss normally
